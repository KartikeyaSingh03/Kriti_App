## How does this app work?

After opening the app for the first time, user is directed to the Sign In or Register Page.
 
There are two types of users: 1) General Users

                              2) Clubs and Departments
                             
Any general user can register themselves and their data and credentials would be saved in the databse.
But Clubs and Departments cannot register. Their are pre - registered by the Admin who provides them with their login credentials.

Any type of user can view all of the videos and pdfs uploaded, also they can add a new Book, Slides, Reading Material (All in PDF format).
General users cannot upload a video to a course or create a new course. Only Clubs and Departments can do that.
